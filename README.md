## About The Project

Dollar Tree is a discount variety store where all items in the store are priced $1.00 or less. Dollar Tree normally deals in small transactions per 
customer (customers only purchasing less than 30 items). When a customer purchases over 30 items, they create problems for each store. So in an effort to 
minimize purchases over 30 items Dollar Tree has started to push an online store. In the online store, the customer can buy in black (cases); in other 
words, customers can and may only buy items that they want from online in bulk orders.

One of our group members had previously worked at Dollar Tree for three years. So aggregating the group memnerâ€™s experience with interviews with Dollar 
Tree management and current employees, we established the best way to set up the database. The system for cash registers at most Dollar Tree convenience 
stores currently run on Windows XP servers; it is clearly an outdated system that is no longer supported and maintained by Microsoft. Furthermore, the 
team has decided to build a database system that will be much more efficient and run on any kind of hardware and will be built using modern methods to 
build software.
